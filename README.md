# GIPHY Anywhere

Sometimes you're composing a chat message or closing a PR, and the need to insert a gif strikes, but opening a new browser window would totally break your flow. GIPHY Anywhere to the rescue!

GIPHY Anywhere is a status bar item that lets you browse GIPHY for gifs.

## Installation

1. Build and install the applet:
```bash
./install.sh
```

## Usage

Whenever the urge to gif strikes, just open the GIPHY Anywhere status bar item, find a gif to fit your mood, and then copy the URL using the menu item. You can copy either the plain URL, or the URL wrapped in Github Markdown.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere, and by the rich gif culture at my place of work.

## Why?

The GIPHY keyboard is great on iOS, and I miss it whenever I'm using macOS. Seeing vim-anywhere gave me the motivation to solve my problem in a similar way.
